## Terminologies

|Terminology|Description|
|---|---|
|**FOSS**|Free Open Source Software - can view code, make and distribute modifications|


## Linux Components

- Kernel
    - The core of the OS
    - Contains components like device drivers
    - Lods into RAM whne machine boots and stays till power off
- Shell
    - Provides interface to communicate with kernel
    - Bash is the most commonly used shell on Linux
    - Shells parse commands entered by user and translate the mto logical segments to be executed by the kernel or other utilities

Hardware communicates with Kernel
Kernel communicates with Shell
Shell communicates with User

Each version could have more than one release

## Linux Directories Tree

Linux interprets everything as files 
Linux doesn't need extensions

|Directory|Description|
|---|---|
|```/```  |root|
|```/bin/```| binary files|
|```/opt/```| optional (3rd tool party apps)|
|```/boot/```||
|```/root/```| home directory for root user|
|```/dev/```| device partitions, etc... files|
|```/sbin/```| system binary files - only admin runnable, root configurable|
|```/etc/```| configuration files of the system - root configurable|
|```/srv/```||
|```/home/```| all home directories of all users - only directory user having full access to|
|```/tmp/```| temporary files - caching files, vscode builds - "in RAM", related to swap|
|```/lib/```|libraries of binary files|
|```/usr/```|ubuntu and debian have symbolic links between usr/bin and /bin|
|```/media/```|any external device |
|```/var/```| log files, anything varying, caches, spool (mails)|
|```/mnt/```| temporary mount file|
|```/proc/```| process related files|

If an option takes an argument we cannot combine this option with other options

## Permissions

|Permission|File Access                     |Directory Access               |
|----------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|
|Read      |Display file contents & copy    |Can list the directory content |
|Write     |Modify the file contents        |wx -> add and delete files     |
|Execute   |Execute/if shell and rx         |cd, rx -> ls -l                |

> to delete a file, no need for any permissions on the file, only wx on parent dir

```chmod permission filename```

Permissions specified in either:
- Symbolic mode:
    - Who
        - u: owner permissions
        - g: group permissions
        - o: other permissions
        - a: all   permissions
    - Operator
        - +: add    permissions
        - -: remove permissions
        - =: assign permissions
    - Permissions
        - r: read    permission
        - w: write   permission
        - x: execute permission
- Octal mode:
    - 4: read
    - 2: write
    - 1: execute

example: ```chmod u+x,go+r file1```, ```chmod a=rw file1```, ```chmod 555 file1```

## Users & Groups


```/etc/passwd``` 
username : password : userId : groupID : comment : homeDir : bash

```/etc/shadow```
username : password : lastChanged : min : max : warn : inactive : expire : futureUse

```bash
useradd -u userID -g groupID -c "Comment" -md /home/user -s fullPathOfShell userName
```

```passwd userName```

```bash
groupadd -g groupID groupName
```

```bash
usermod -g primaryGroup -aG secondaryGroup userName
```

```ls -la /etc/skel``` -> config files by default created for new users

```useradd -D```

```newusers filename```

```usermod -l newLoginName -L lockPassword -U unlockPassword```

```userdel -r username```

Change group of the files ```chgrp groupName fileNames``` -> ```chgrp os f1 f2 f3```

Temporarily change the primary group of user ```newgrp os``` -> ```exit```

Switch to another user with known commands ```su - user -c command options arguments; ...```

chown user1 file1

chown user1:group1 file1

chown :group1 file1

---

ls -l
Owner, Group, Others #ofLinks ownerName groupName sizeOfFile dateOfCreation nameOfFile

```:%s/Linux/Unix/g```

```:1,3m7```

umask, alias & env vars are temporary (reset in new terminals)

man bash returns all shell variables

```env```, ```printenv``` show all env vars with values
```PS1, PS2, ...```

Environment in file -> user    environment
Environment in cli  -> session environment

alias c=clear
unalis c
\ls -> ignores alias "ls"

/home/user/.profile, /home/user/.bash_login, ...
/etc/.profile
/home/user.bashrc

## Processes, Priorities, and Signals Concepts
> Every running program creates a process. Eg, shell, command, application

> **Daemons** are processes running in background and provide services

### Process

-> Every process has a PID (process ID)

-> Waiting parent when child is done, parent is zombie process

-> Waiting child when parent is terminated, child is orphan process

-> Linux uses Round Robin + Priority

-> Niceness values range from **-20 to 19** (depending on distribution), **default is 0**

```bash
# Show all running in terminal
ps
PID         TTY      TIME       CMD
16946       pts/1    00:00:00   bash
16956       pts/1    00:00:00   ps

ps -l
F   S   UID     PID     PPID    C   PRI  NI ADDR SZ WCHAN  TTY          TIME CMD
0   S   1000    16946   16872   0   80   0 -  3475 do_wai pts/1    00:00:00 bash
0   R   1000    17035   16946   0   80   0 -  3824 -      pts/1    00:00:00 ps

ps -f
UID        PID      PPID    C   STIME   TTY      TIME       CMD
john       16946    16872   0   09:32   pts/1    00:00:00   bash
john       17287    16946   0   09:34   pts/1    00:00:00   ps -f

# Show all running processes on device
ps -e

# Show processes in a tree
pstree

# Run a process in background
gedit &
[jobID] processID


# Adjusting process priority at invocation time
nice [-n adjustment] command
nice -n 20 gedit

renice [adjustment -p processID]
renice 10 -p 3299
```

### Signals
> A signal is a message sent to a process to perform a certain action

- Signals are identified by a **signal number**, **signal name**, **associated action**

|Term|Description|
|-|-|
|Terminate|Closes if ready but not running|
|Kill|Kill signal - Forces closing even if running|
|Stop|Stops process|
|Cont|Continue signal if stopped|


```bash
# List jobs
jobs

# Send stop signal to job ID 1
kill -STOP %1

# Run process in foreground
fg [processID / %jobID]

# Run process in background
bg [processID / %jobID]

top

```

### Searching for a process

```bash
pgrep searchTerm # Return the id
pgrep -l searchTerm # Return the id and name
pgerp -lx searchTerm # Return the id and name of exact searchTerm
pgrep -lu username # Return the id and name of processes running on the user environment
```

- ctrl-Z stops fg process


## Redirection, Pipeline, String Processing

### Redirection

```bash
Command >  fname # output redirection
Command >> fname # output redirection (append)
Command <  fname # input redirection
Command 2> fname # error output redirection

#Examples:
$ find /etc -name passwd > findresult
$ ls -l /etc >> findresult
Mail < file1
```

File descriptor for each command:
- 0: standard input 0<
- 1: standard output 1>
- 2: standard error 2>

### Pipeline
> A pipe (|) is used to send the output of one command as the input to the other

```bash
# Tee command reads from std input and writes to std output and a file
$ ls -lR / | tee fname | more
```

### String Processing

```bash
cut -d: -f1,5,6 /etc/passwd

sort -k4 -t: -n /etc/passwd

grep bash$ /etc/passwd | cut -d: -f1
```
