# Computer System Structure

Any computer system can be divided into 4 main components:
1. Hardware - provides basic computing resources
    > CPU, RAM, IO
2. Operating System - controls use of hardware among apps and users
3. Apps - define the ways that the users will use the system resources
    > Word, compilers, browser, db, games
4. Users
    > People, other computers, machines

## What is OS?

An OS is a program (SW) **managing the HW**, the intermediary between the user and the OS.

Users want convenience, ease of use and good performance
But shared computers must keep all users happy

**The kernel is the one program running at all times on the computer**
