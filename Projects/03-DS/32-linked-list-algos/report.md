which of them suits linked list 
which of them are bad for linked list
which cannot be done with linked list , or can be implemented with a work around


- Binary search on a linked list is inefficient. Finding the middle costs O(n) and searching takes O(), so total complexity is O(n log n).

- Linear search on a linked list is more efficient in O(n) and simple to implement with one pointer (head or tail).
