# Memory Management

## Fragments and Defragmentation

base + limit
Logical  = page + offset
Physical = frame + offset

### External fragmentation

holes in memory preventing me from assigning big processes in multiple small holes

## Logical vs Physical Address Space

data bus determines how many bytes to be used

address bus determines how many bytes existing

## Swapping

## Continous Allocation

### First Fit

### Best Fit

### Worst Fit

## Paging

## Segmentation
