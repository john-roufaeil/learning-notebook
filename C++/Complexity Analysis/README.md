# Complexity Analysis

Defines the behavior of the algorithm in time and space.

O(1) doesn't mean it's fast, it could take 3 hours or days but it means it is constant, it's always going to be the same time.

Asymptotic/Tail behavior -> limit of the function if its domain tends to infinity

## Asymptotic Boundaries

n, nlogn, sqr(n)log(n), n^2, n^3, n!

01. log(log(n))
02. log(sqr(n)), log(n)
03. log^2(n)
04. sqrt(n)
05. 
06. 
07. 
08. 
09. n^2
10. n^3
11. n!
